# p5 Project

This project was to create something in sketch.js and p5.js using javascript to teach a certain concept. I decided to make a hummingbird game where the goal was to achieve max health by pollinating the good (non-rose) flowers and moving quickly (since hummingbirds move fast!). If one moves their cursor near the roses, the hummingbird's health bar drops, stopping at 0 -- and if they don't move (or don't go near the flowers), their health bar will stay the same. But once a hummingbird pollinates the right flowers for long enough, the hummingbird's health will go to 100 and a little "congrats" message will show up for passing the level.

Here are some pictures of the game :)
